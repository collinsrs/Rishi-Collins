## Rishi Collins


I am an aspiring student studying software development. I build websites and applications for fun for myself, and hopefully for others very soon. My work and expertise is still being worked on, but I hope you join me on my long journey ahead!

You can view my repositories on GitHub, or find me on my other socials, right from this page. Enjoy!
